# Vision Document: TaaS for Agentic AI 

## 1. Executive Summary 
In the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), true agentic AI requires the 
ability to extend native capabilities by dynamically invoking external helper functions. 
Our platform is a Tools-as-a-Service (TaaS) solution built on a standardized, MCP 
based (Model Context Protocol) invocation layer. It not only enables LLMs to 
autonomously select and execute pre-built helper functions but also empowers users 
to create new tools on demand, simply by providing a cURL command or a description 
of what the tool should do. This dynamic, plug‑and‑play ecosystem will unlock 
unprecedented flexibility, scalability, and monetization opportunities for developers, 
enterprises, and AI startups. 

## 2. Product Vision and Objectives 

### Product Vision 
We envision a unified platform that acts as the backbone for AI agents, allowing them to 
seamlessly extend their functionality by invoking external tools. The platform will serve 
as both a marketplace and a development hub where: 

- **Tool Consumption**: AI systems can dynamically discover and execute helper functions 
defined via a standardized JSON format. 
- **Tool Creation**: Users regardless of coding expertise can create new tools using simple 
inputs such as cURL commands or plain-text descriptions. Our system automatically 
generates the tool's metadata and code, making it ready for immediate deployment. 

### Core Objectives 
- **Standardization**: Leverage MCP to ensure all tools follow a uniform interface and 
communication protocol. 
- **Autonomy**: Enable LLMs to decide, based on rich context, which helper function to 
invoke during multi-step tasks. 
- **Scalability**: Support both consumption and on-demand creation of tools, growing into 
a robust marketplace. 
- **Security**: Implement sandboxing, certification, and strict access controls for every tool 
to guarantee safe execution. 
- **Monetization**: Offer diverse revenue streams from usage-based fees to enterprise 
subscriptions and marketplace commissions to fuel ongoing innovation and 
sustainability. 

## 3. Product Overview 

### Key Features 

#### Dynamic Tool Discovery: 
LLMs are provided with a JSON-formatted catalogue of tools that includes descriptions, 
input/output schemas, and metadata. This enables auto-discovery and context-aware 
invocation. 

#### Automated Tool Creation: 
Users can create new tools by submitting either: 
1. A cURL command (to integrate with an existing API endpoint), or 
2. A textual description of the desired functionality (e.g., "Fetch the current weather 
for a given city"). 
3. The system parses the input, validates and standardizes the tool's interface, and 
generates a preview for review before publishing it to the marketplace. 

#### Seamless Integration: 
Support for both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP/SSE) deployments ensures that tools 
are always available for LLM invocation, regardless of the deployment environment. 

#### Developer SDKs & Documentation: 
Comprehensive SDKs and guides (Python, TypeScript, Java, etc.) facilitate tool creation, 
integration, and deployment, fostering a vibrant developer community. 

#### Analytics & Monitoring: 
Real-time dashboards and detailed logging enable users to track tool usage, 
performance, and revenue metrics. 

#### Marketplace Ecosystem: 
A centralized registry and marketplace where third-party developers can list, monetize, 
and update their MCP-compliant tools. 

## 4. Architectural Overview 

### Core Components 

#### MCP Client/Server Architecture: 
- **MCP Clients**: Integrated within AI applications (e.g., OpenAI Assistants, LangChain 
agents) to retrieve and execute available tool definitions. 
- **MCP Servers**: Host the actual tool implementations, providing standardized JSON-RPC 
interfaces for tool invocation. 

#### Tool Registry & Marketplace: 
A central catalog that stores tool metadata, enabling dynamic discovery and secure 
management of tools across the ecosystem. 

#### Dynamic Tool Creation Engine: 
A specialized module that accepts user inputs (cURL or description), parses the 
necessary parameters, auto-generates the tool's JSON specification and code 
template, and provides an interactive review interface before deployment. 

#### Invocation and Orchestration Layer: 
This layer bridges the LLM's function-calling capabilities with our tool registry, ensuring 
the right helper function is called at the right moment based on contextual cues from 
the system prompt. 

### Integration Flow 

1. **Tool Provisioning & Creation**: 
   - Developers or users submit a cURL command or description. 
   - The creation engine parses, validates, and standardizes the tool's interface. 
   - The tool is previewed, approved, and then published to the registry/marketplace. 

2. **Discovery & Invocation**: 
   - An LLM receives a system prompt alongside a dynamically updated list of tools. 
   - Based on the task context, the LLM decides which helper function to invoke. 
   - The invocation layer executes the selected tool via MCP, and the output is fed back 
   into the AI's response. 

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**: 
   - Every tool invocation is logged and monitored for performance and usage metrics, 
   driving continuous improvements. 

## 4. Monetization Models
